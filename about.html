                <br>
                <p> My name is Mahesh Gokhale and I am a student of MITWPU, Kothrud, Pune. I belong to the branch 
                    of Electronics and Communication engineering, which is a sub-discipline of electrical engineering 
                    and is distinguished by the additional use of active components such as semiconductor devices to 
                    amplify and control electric current flow. My interests are in core electronics, specifically
                    robotics and automation as well as in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.<br>My hobbies 
                    are gaming, listening to music, solving puzzles, reading books, sketching and so on. I also like 
                    to travel once in a while...<br>I have experience in working with various microcontrollers such as
                    C8051, RaspberryPi, Arduino, etc and I have also built projects and worked with elctronic active 
                    components along with these controllers as well as individually. I plan to work in a company 
                    which will best fit my abilities. I will be providing links to my future projects below. Wish me 
                    all the best for future endevours... :)
